## Understanding the Concept of Halal Investing

In Islamic finance, halal investing refers to investment practices that
adhere to Sharia law. This law prohibits activities such as gambling,
excessive risk-taking, and interest-based transactions. Forex trading,
when conducted ethically and in line with Sharia principles, can be
considered halal.
